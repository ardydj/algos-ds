# Week 3 Toy Problems

Welcome to Week 3 of the Job Search Program!

This week, toy problems focus on Arrays and Linked Lists to accompany the DS&A Level-Ups found in [jsp-dsa](https://github.com/hackreactor/jsp-dsa). A new prompt will be released during Toy Problem time on the calendar.

Please read this repo's [updated README](https://github.com/hackreactor/jsp2-toy-problems) for instructions on Weeks 3-7 Toy Problems, including how to receive new toy problems and submit solutions.
