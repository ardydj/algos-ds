PROMPT
---

Given an m x n matrix. If an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Modify the
matrix in-place. In other words, your solution should have a space complexity of 0(1).

EXAMPLES
---

Input: [
    [1,1,1],
    [1,0,1],
    [1,1,1]
]
Output: [
    [1,0,1],
    [0,0,0],
    [1,0,1]
]



Input: [
    [0,1,2,0],
    [3,4,5,2],
    [1,3,1,5]
]
Output: [
    [0,0,0,0],
    [0,4,5,0],
    [0,3,1,0]
]

CONSTRAINTS
---

    1) m == matrix.length
    2) n == matrix[0].length
    3) 1 <= m, n <= 200
    4) -2^31 <= matrix[i][j] <= 2^31 - 1
