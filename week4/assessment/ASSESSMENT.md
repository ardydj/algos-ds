# Week 4 Tech Assessment

Rather than a toy problem today, take a quick, no-stress quiz to see how much you learned
about linked lists and sort algorithms in Weeks 3 and 4, and get a preview into Week 5 topics.
Your score will not be shared with the cohort, and there are no penalties to getting a low score.

You will receive your answers by email (with link to your score/correct answers).
