# Week 4 Toy Problems

Welcome to Week 4 of the Job Search Program!

This week, toy problems focus on Sort Algorithms to accompany [DS&A Level-Up: Sort Algorithms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SKBhRjv0LhjKvUg33K-3bEloPy7n-GH_ibQz5DU8TFk/edit?usp=sharing) found in the [`jsp-dsa`](https://github.com/hackreactor/jsp-dsa) repo. A new prompt will be released during Toy Problem time on the calendar, along with the solution to the previous session's prompt.
