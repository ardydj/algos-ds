# Week 5 Toy Problems

Welcome to Week 5 of the Job Search Program!

This week, toy problems accompany [DS&A Level-Up: Binary Tree, BST & Heapsort](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AWq6mk8h2PqXxZXw4IiajK875RKL4kpPSSNpc2QirRY/edit?usp=sharing) found in the [`jsp-dsa`](https://github.com/hackreactor/jsp-dsa) repo. A new prompt will be released during Toy Problem time on the calendar, along with the solution to the previous session's prompt.
