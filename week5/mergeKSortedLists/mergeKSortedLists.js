PROMPT
---

You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.
Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

There are several approaches to this problem ~ if you don't know where to start, read the 
Solution tab for this prompt on Leetcode:
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/solution/

Try to implement at least two solutions using DS&A from the past few weeks.

EXAMPLES
---

Example 1:
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6


Example 2:
Input: lists = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []

---
CONSTRAINTS
---
  1) k == lists.length 
  2) 0 <= k <= 10^4 
  3) 0 <= lists[i].length <= 500 
  4) -10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4 
  5) lists[i] is sorted in ascending order. 
  6) The sum of lists[i].length won't exceed 10^4.
